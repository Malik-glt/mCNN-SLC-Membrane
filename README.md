Integrating Pre-Trained Protein Language Model and Multiple Window Scanning Deep Learning Networks for Accurate Identification of Secondary Active Transporters in Membrane Proteins
We suggest combining multiple-window scanning with pre-trained protein language model encodings in order to identify secondary active transport proteins. Protein sequences contain biological information that we hope to decode. We believe that multiple window scanning and protein-pretrained language model embedding can aid in the comprehension of membrane proteins versus secondary active transporters. We provide efficient identification and classification techniques that aid biologists in understanding these transporters and their intricate role in cancer.
